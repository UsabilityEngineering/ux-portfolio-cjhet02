# Jhet's UX Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my UX Portfolio. My name is Jhet (like an airplane) and I am a senior at CSU Chico majoring in Computer Science, while also pursuing the Data Science certificate. I've just finished the summer leg of an internship with HPE, and am now working part time for them during the school year.
