# Yep, it's still there. Now what?
Everyone that's been driving a car for a good amount of time has experienced it: the **check engine light**. If you aren't aware of what the check engine light is, it is a beacon of despair. A harbinger of anxiety and misfortunes to come. In other words, it means your car detected something wrong, but is too shy to tell you what the problem actually is.

Above you can see what it looks like when my car's check engine light is on, as well as a couple others (from google, not my own car luckily). Starting from the top is the maintainence required light. This is a minor inconvenience that simply needs to be cleared away once routine maintainence (eg. an oil change) is completed. At the bottom we can see the oil light, check engine light, and battery lights from left to right. There is beauty in simplicity, and these lights all follow the general conventions of how they tend to appear in most cars. The oil light means that the oil is not circulating properly in the car, and the battery light means the battery is losing charge without replenishing it. Both are useful and only have one reason for appearing. The issue lies in the aforementioned check engine light. A user with no knowledge of these lights would likely have little issue deciphering what most of them mean, with a quick google search available to confirm their suspicions. The check engine light, however, contains no such simplicity. When this light comes on, it means that one of the many sensors in the car failed a test, and the only way to know which sensor or what it means is to view the error codes stored in the computer using the **OBD Port**.

Seen above is the location of the aforementioned OBD (**O**n**B**oard **D**iagnostics) port in my car. Most have a location like this, hidded from view in the driver's footwell, this is already an inconvenience, but an understandable one. As you may be able to tell by the acronym, it is an interface through which you can access diagnostic (problem solving) data stored in the vehicles computer. This is not a port that exists outside of the vehicle sphere either, so you won't have any luck trying to connect to it with a USB cable. Instead, you need a specialized tool called an OBD scanner or reader. This device connects to the oddly shaped port and allows the user to view what codes are causing the light's appearance in a (slightly) more convenient way. It goes without saying that this is an awful wau of handling such a wide array of possible failures. From a loose gas cap to multiple cylinder failures, the range of urgency that is covered by one light, with one setting, in one color is a painfully poor design decision.

Drivers that don't have knowledge of the possible causes of of the check engine light will likely see it and realize they need the help of a mechanic, and will either react with anxiety or indifference. Both of these outcomes could be completely contrary to the actual severity of the issue. Those that are aware of the light's nature will only experience the former reaction: anxiety and worry. This is effective in a way, as the light is designed to be a warning of a system failure, but the lack of indication of the error's severity is still an issue. All it would take is adding another color, or even a flashing mode to indicate 2-3 levels of failure, as opposed to just "uh-oh".
